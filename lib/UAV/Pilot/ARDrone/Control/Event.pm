=head1 NAME

  UAV::Pilot::ARDrone::Control::Event

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $cv = AnyEvent->condvar;
    my $event = UAV::Pilot::EasyEvent->new({
        condvar => $cv,
    });
    
    my $driver = UAV::Pilot::Driver::ARDrone->new( ... );
    $driver->connect;
    my $dev = UAV::Pilot::Control::ARDrone::Event->new({
        driver               => $driver,
        joystick_num         => 0,
        joystick_takeoff_btn => 3,
    });
    $uav->init_event_loop( $cv, $event );

    $dev->pitch( -0.8 );
    $cv->recv; # Will now pitch forward until you kill the process

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AnyEvent-based version of C<UAV::Pilot::Control::ARDrone>.  With the normal module, you 
need to send movement commands yourself every 30ms to maintain smooth control.  By using 
an event loop, this module handles the timing for you.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 init_event_loop

    init_event_loop( $cv, $event )

Sets up the event loop.  Takes C<$cv> (an C<AnyEvent::Condvar>) and C<$event> 
(a C<UAV::Pilot::EasyEvent>).

Will listen for joystick events.

=head2 hover

Stops all movement.
